# 2dRobotControlSystem
This object-oriented programming project has been developed for controlling (moving and receiving data from sensors) of the robot in a 2D mobile robot simulator.
Necessary classes are coded considering the class libraries required for controlling the robot with MobilSim.
The project consists of 9 classes. Each class is coded for the robot to perform its different tasks.
